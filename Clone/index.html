        <p class="lead-paragraph"><b>Peafowl</b> is a common name for three bird species in the genera <i>Pavo</i> and the closely related genus <i>Afropavo</i>, within the tribe Pavonini of the family <i>Phasianidae</i> (the pheasants and allies). The males of all species are called peacocks, and the females are called peahens. The young are known as peachicks. The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is the most studied and best-known species.</p>

        <h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy and Species</h2>
        <p>The term peafowl encompasses three distinct species native to Asia and Africa. The two Asiatic species, the Indian and Green peafowl, are closely related, while the African Congo peafowl is placed in its own genus due to morphological and ecological differences.</p>
        
        <h3>Indian Peafowl (Pavo cristatus)</h3>
        <p>Native to the Indian subcontinent, it is the most widespread and recognized species. Males are known for their iridescent blue neck and breast and their exceptionally long train of upper tail coverts. This species is often semi-domesticated and found near human habitation.</p>

        <h3>Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus)</h3>
        <p>Found in Southeast Asia, this species has a metallic green neck and breast, with both sexes appearing quite similar, though the male has a longer train. The Green Peafowl is classified as **Endangered** due to habitat fragmentation and hunting.</p>

        <h3>Congo Peafowl (Afropavo congensis)</h3>
        <p>This species is endemic to the Congo Basin in Africa. It lacks the long ornamental train seen in the Asiatic species. The male is dark blue with a green crest, and the female is a dull chestnut colour. It was the last peafowl species to be discovered in 1936.</p>

        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>The Indian Peacock is a large bird. The male stands about 90–130 cm (35–50 in) tall and weighs 4–6 kg (8.8–13.2 lbs). The most defining feature is the train, which is not the tail feathers itself, but rather the highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers bear a complex pattern of iridescent eyespots, or ocelli, which are crucial for courtship. The vibrant colors are produced by structural coloration, where microscopic, crystal-like structures in the barbules diffract light rather than relying on pigments.</p>
        
        <p>The peahen (Pavo cristatus female) is smaller, about 95 cm (37 in) long, and weighs 2.8–4 kg (6.2–8.8 lbs). She has a mottled brown, buff, and white plumage, which provides excellent camouflage for nesting on the ground. She does not have a long train, but a crested head.</p>

        <h2 id="behaviour">Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
        <p>Peafowl are diurnal birds that spend most of their day foraging on the forest floor. They are known to be highly social and tend to gather in small flocks of five to ten birds. They are notoriously shy of humans in the wild but become tame in areas where they are accustomed to human presence. Their most prominent anti-predator behaviour is their extremely loud, far-carrying call, a distinctive and often piercing "may-awe" sound, which serves as an alarm signal for other species in the jungle.</p>
        
        <p>At night, peafowl roost high up in tall trees or on man-made structures to protect themselves from terrestrial predators such as tigers and leopards. They are capable of sustained flight over short distances, especially when escaping danger.</p>

        <h2 id="diet">Diet and Feeding</h2>
        <p>Peafowl are omnivorous. Their diet is highly varied and includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Plant Matter: Seeds, grain, wild figs, berries, and tender shoots. They can often be found near cultivated fields.</li>
            <li>Invertebrates: A large number of insects, including grasshoppers, termites, and beetles, as well as earthworms and slugs.</li>
            <li>Vertebrates: They are known to prey on small mammals, lizards, and even small, venomous snakes, showing a degree of immunity to snake venom, although this is debated.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="reproduction">Reproduction and Courtship</h2>
        <p>Peafowl are polygynous, with a male peacock maintaining a harem of two to five peahens. The breeding season typically coincides with the monsoon rains. The most significant element of courtship is the male's display, where he spreads his train into a massive, shimmering fan in front of the peahen. This display serves to demonstrate his fitness.</p>
        
        <p>Studies have shown that females assess the males based on several factors:
          <ul>
            <li>Ocelli Count: Peacocks with a higher number of intact eyespots are more attractive.</li>
            <li>Vibration: The rattling sound and low-frequency vibrations (infrasound) generated by the shaking of the feathers during the display may also be a key signal.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>After mating, the peahen lays 3–5 eggs in a clutch, usually in a shallow scrape on the ground hidden in dense undergrowth. The incubation period is about 28 days, and the male plays no role in raising the young.</p>

        <h2 id="habitat">Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>The Indian Peafowl is distributed across the Indian subcontinent, thriving in both moist and dry deciduous forests. They prefer open forest habitats, often near rivers or streams, and readily adapt to agricultural regions and suburban environments. Their population is dense in many parts of India, where they enjoy legal protection.</p>

        <h2 id="in_culture">In Culture</h2>
        <p>The peacock has been highly revered throughout history and holds immense cultural significance.
          <ul>
            <li>India (National Bird): Symbolizing grace, joy, beauty, and love, the peacock is the National Bird of India. It is associated with the Hindu deity Kartikeya (Murugan), who is often depicted riding the bird.</li>
            <li>Ancient Mythology: In Greek mythology, the peacock was the sacred animal of the goddess Hera. In the story of Io and Argus Panoptes, Hera supposedly placed the hundred eyes of the dead giant Argus onto the peacock's tail.</li>
            <li>Christianity: In early Christian art, the peacock was adopted as a symbol of the Resurrection and immortality because of an ancient belief that its flesh did not decay.</li>
          </ul>
